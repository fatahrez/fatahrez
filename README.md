### Hi there Nerd ðŸ‘‹
I love solving problems. Ask me anything Android, Machine Learning or Django. 

Fun fact, I love comedy (Might be a stand up comedian someday). I work at Moringa School where I mentor future rockstar coders. If you would like to reach out follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Abdullfertah)
