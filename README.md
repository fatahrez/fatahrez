### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I love solving problems. Ask me anything Android. Outside coding life I like watching and playing football, also listening to music.

Fun fact, I love comedy (Might be a stand up comedian someday). I work at Moringa School where I mentor future rockstar coders. If you would like to reach out follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Abdullfertah)
